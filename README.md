# charduindicator
(**char**lieplexed **ardu**ino **indicator**)

This is an Arduino project that controls a 4x5 LED charlieplexed display, via simple serial commands such as `on 1` (to turn on the first LED) and `off 20` (to turn off the twentieth LED).

It has been tested with an Arduino Uno and a 4x5 LED display I soldered by hand. The wiring is somewhat simple, but a schematic can be seen [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Controlling-20-Leds-from-5-Arduino-pins-using-Cha/step3/The-first-problem-Wiring-it-properly/) (NOT my own schematic/instructable).
